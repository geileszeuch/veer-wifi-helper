Here is some tips of veer wifi driver.

1. Veer WiFi chip is BCM4319.

2. Veer WiFi driver source code can be found on http://downloads.help.palm.com/opensource/2.1.2/dhd.tgz
There is also a patch, but the dhd.tgz has been patched, so you don't have to.
Use 'cd 2.1.2/dhd/linux; make LINUXDIR=XXX dhd-cdc-sdmmc-oob-gpl' to make it.
Then the driver will be located in 2.1.2/dhd/linux/dhd-cdc-sdmmc-oob-gpl-2.6.29/dhd.ko

3. The firmware and vars file are located in /lib/firmware/bcm4319.bin and /lib/firmware/bcm4319.txt in Veer.
You should modify the vars file(bcm4319.txt), "macaddr=00:90:4c:14:4A:AB", to your own macaddr.

4. The firmware download helper is located in /lib/firmware/dhd
Use following command to probe driver.
insmod /lib/modules/2.6.29-palm-shank/kernel/net/wifi/dhd.ko dhd_mac_address=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
/lib/firmware/dhd -i eth0 download /lib/firmware/bcm4319.bin /lib/firmware/bcm4319.txt

5. WiFi will not get up automatically, so you need to make it up, by sendding a private command WL_UP
I have coded it in wifi_up.c

That's all.
